However, the VRLTA defines rent as \u201call money, \n\nother than a security deposit, owed or paid to the landlord under the rental agreement, \n\nincluding prepaid rent paid more than one month in advance of the rent due date,\u201d which \n\nbroadens rent to include other fees and damages incurred under the lease. (See Virginia \n\nCode Sections 55-248.4 and 55-248.32.)  \n\n \n\nWhile rent may seem a straightforward category of damages, there are some \n\nissues to keep in mind.  First of all, as briefly noted in the Eviction guide, the July 2014 \n\nunlawful detainer form includes a box that indicates that the plaintiff will seek rent owed \n\nas of the date of the hearing.  It is important to check that box so that you can easily \n\namend the amount of rent you are seeking (in lieu of more complicated motions for leave \n\nto amend).  However, there will always be additional rent after the first contested hearing, \n\nso how can you recover that additional rent?  There are two options a plaintiff can pursue. \n\n \n\n Before 2005, after a plaintiff has successfully completed the unlawful detainer \n\naction, he or she would have to file a warrant in debt for any rent and damages not \n\nrecovered under unlawful detainer action.  Currently, the main appeal to this method is \n\nthat the landlord has time to fully assess all of his damages and document his claim \n\naccordingly.  Additionally, certain landlords as a business model have an organizational \n\nseparation between unlawful detainers and collecting outstanding debts, for example \n\nretaining collection agencies for the latter.  The downside to that approach is that it \n\ninvolves separate litigation with additional costs and extra efforts (such as finding and \n\nserving the tenant for whom you may not have any contact information). \n\n \n\n As briefly noted Step Six, since 2005, Virginia Code Section 8.01-128 has \n\nallowed a plaintiff to bifurcate the unlawful detainer action as to possession and damages.  \n\n\n\nPage 18 of 24 \n\n \n\nThis allows a landlord to capture more damages in a single unlawful detainer action.  The \n\nhearing on damages must be held within 120 days of the hearing on possession.  \n\nHowever, the 120-day period should capture the significant majority, if not all, of a \n\nlandlord\u2019s damages.  Before the damages hearing, the landlord will have possession of \n\nthe premises and will be able to fully assess any damage above normal wear and tear.  \n\nFurthermore, if the landlord is able to re-rent the leased premises during that time period \n\nthen that turnover period, in which no rent was received, can be claimed as outstanding \n\nrent.  If the premises are still not re-rented, then at least the landlord can claim the entire \n\n120-day window.  Keep in mind, however, that the landlord must make a good-faith \n\neffort to mitigate the damages, which would include standard business efforts to re-rent \n\nthe premises.   \n\n \n\nLate Fees \n\n \n\n Virginia Code Section 55-248.7 specifically authorizes a landlord to charge a fee \n\nfor a tenant\u2019s late payments, although it does not specify an amount.  Courts will \n\nnormally view late fees as a matter of contract law and will strictly construe the statutory \n\nlanguage, allowing for reasonable \u201clate charges contracted for in a written rental \n\nagreement.\u201d  However, Courts will weigh the reasonableness of assessed late fees."}, {"attributes": {}, "file_id": "file-4LQzSWD1z411ZwNa8KTiQB", "filename": "PMX_HANDOUT_WED_Unlawful-Detainer_Grimes_Creasy.pdf", "score": 0.23112862114601498, "text": "reduction of the trigger number under Virginia Code Section 55-248.3:1(B), the majority \n\nof residential leases will now be covered by the VRLTA.  Further, in recent legislative \n\nsessions, the General Assembly has begun placing multiple sections of the VRLTA into \n\nthe Landlord and Tenant Act\n2\n, which has significantly reduced the differences between \n\nthe two Acts.  Therefore, this outline will focus primarily on the eviction process for \n\nVRLTA properties. Although there are still remaining differences between the VRLTA \n\nand the Landlord and Tenant Act, the VRLTA is more comprehensive and more often \n\nrelied upon and referred to in unlawful detainer actions than the Landlord and Tenant \n\nAct.  Thus, the VRLTA will be the main focus and subject of this outline and CLE \n\ncourse.  Differences between the two Acts will be noted along each step of the guide. \n\n \n\nSTEP ONE - Identify a Breach of the Lease \n\n \n\nProperty managers and landlords often articulate problems created by tenants, but \n\nthey routinely fail to link the tenant\u2019s behavior with a particular lease provision or \n\napplicable statute.  Property managers and landlords must be instructed to identify the \n\n                                                        \n1\n Virginia Code Sections 55-248.2 through 55-248.40. \n\n2\n Virginia Code Sections 55-217 through 55-248. \n\n\n\nPage 2 of 24 \n\n \n\nprecise nature of the breach, and they have to be instructed to detail the underlying breach \n\nin the subject notice.  \n\n \n\nThe following are common examples of instances whereby a tenant breaches a \n\nlease agreement or statutory provision: \n\n \n\n\uf0b7 Example 1:  Failure to pay rent \n\n \n\no Although one would assume that landlords quickly address tenants who \n\nfail to pay monthly rent; however, landlords regularly fail to address this \n\nissue quickly.  Landlord\u2019s often accept a partial payment and hope that the \n\ntenant\u2019s next payment will be for the full amount owed.  Once a tenant \n\nstarts to fall behind, non-payment usually follows, which becomes \n\ncompounded with the imposition of late fees. Thus, landlords should \n\nadhere to a consistent policy of sending notices unless they receive the full \n\nrent amount.   \n\n \n\n\uf0b7 Example 2:  Breach of quiet enjoyment \n\n \n\no Well written leases contain a provision requiring that a tenant respect the \n\nquiet enjoyment of the leased premises and common areas.  Situations \n\noften arise whereby tenants cause disturbances disrupting other tenants.  \n\nPractitioners should encourage their landlord/property manager clients to \n\ndocument any such incidents.  Thorough documentation will make success \n\nduring the trial phase more likely.  Landlords should send 21/30 material \n\nnon-compliance notices following such a breach. The number of 21/30 \n\nnotices to be sent prior to filling a Summons for Unlawful Detainer is \n\nusually dictated by the severity of the breach. \n\n \n\n\uf0b7 Example 3:  Failure to abide by occupancy restrictions \n\n \n\no Most leases require the prospect to list individuals, who will be living on \n\nthe premises.  Many leases also require that only those individuals listed in \n\nthe lease reside on the premises.  On occasion, tenants will permit \n\nunauthorized friends and family to move into the leased premises.  These \n\nsituations are difficult for property managers and landlords to detect and to \n\nprove. Mail carriers may report to the staff when a given residence \n\nreceives large amounts of mail to an unauthorized person within the leased"}, {"attributes": {}, "file_id": "file-4LQzSWD1z411ZwNa8KTiQB", "filename": "PMX_HANDOUT_WED_Unlawful-Detainer_Grimes_Creasy.pdf", "score": 0.22519282416356715, "text": "the tenant must be permitted to remain in the leased premises.  The tenant, however, may \n\nonly invoke this right of redemption once within a 12-month period.  If the tenant timely \n\ninvokes the one right of redemption, then the landlord must dismiss the pending unlawful \n\ndetainer action at that time.  The landlord should retain proof of the tenant\u2019s exercise of \n\nthe one right of redemption.  This will afford the landlord proof that the tenant has \n\nalready exercised his or her one right of redemption should the tenant fail to timely pay \n\nthe rent required under the lease agreement within the next 12-month period. \n\n \n\nQuestions:   \n\n \n\n1)    Can a landlord accept partial rent and still have the tenant evicted from the \n\nunit? \n\n \n\nPursuant to Virginia Code Section 55-248.34:1, the landlord may accept rent or \n\npartial rent with reservation and still seek possession of the leased premises.  To \n\navoid a waiver by accepting rent or partial rent, the landlord must strictly comply \n\nwith the requirements set forth under Virginia Code Sections 55-225.47 and 55-\n\n248.34:1.   \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\nPage 17 of 24 \n\n \n\nDAMAGES \n \n\nThe VRLTA allows the landlord to claim the following damages if the lease \n\nagreement is terminated: \n\n \n\n 1. Possession;  \n\n 2.  Rent; \n\n 3.  Late Fees; \n\n 4.  Costs \n\n 5.  Reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees; \n\n 6.  Actual damages of the breach. \n\n \n\nPossession \n\n \n\n How to obtain possession is discussed in detail in the preceding sections of this \n\noutline.   \n\n \n\nRent \n\n \n\n Most people think of rent as simply the required monthly payment the tenant \n\nmakes as specified under the lease.  However, the VRLTA defines rent as \u201call money, \n\nother than a security deposit, owed or paid to the landlord under the rental agreement, \n\nincluding prepaid rent paid more than one month in advance of the rent due date,\u201d which \n\nbroadens rent to include other fees and damages incurred under the lease. (See Virginia \n\nCode Sections 55-248.4 and 55-248.32.)  \n\n \n\nWhile rent may seem a straightforward category of damages, there are some \n\nissues to keep in mind.  First of all, as briefly noted in the Eviction guide, the July 2014 \n\nunlawful detainer form includes a box that indicates that the plaintiff will seek rent owed \n\nas of the date of the hearing.  It is important to check that box so that you can easily \n\namend the amount of rent you are seeking (in lieu of more complicated motions for leave \n\nto amend).  However, there will always be additional rent after the first contested hearing, \n\nso how can you recover that additional rent?  There are two options a plaintiff can pursue. \n\n \n\n Before 2005, after a plaintiff has successfully completed the unlawful detainer \n\naction, he or she would have to file a warrant in debt for any rent and damages not \n\nrecovered under unlawful detainer action.  Currently, the main appeal to this method is \n\nthat the landlord has time to fully assess all of his damages and document his claim \n\naccordingly.  Additionally, certain landlords as a business model have an organizational \n\nseparation between unlawful detainers and collecting outstanding debts, for example \n\nretaining collection agencies for the latter.  The downside to that approach is that it"}, {"attributes": {}, "file_id": "file-4LQzSWD1z411ZwNa8KTiQB", "filename": "PMX_HANDOUT_WED_Unlawful-Detainer_Grimes_Creasy.pdf", "score": 0.2065452675138729, "text": "2) execute the writ of possession and store the personal property in a storage area \n\ndesignated by the landlord (which can be the leased premises itself) for 24 hours \n\nand then dispose of it.  \n\n  \n\nIf the landlord chooses the storage area option, the tenant must be provided access, at \n\nreasonable times, to the personal property until the landlord disposes of it.  If such \n\nreasonable access is denied, the tenant is entitled to injunctive relief and any other relief \n\nprovided by law.  \n\n \n\nPursuant to Virginia Code Section 55-248.38:3, upon the death of a tenant, who is \n\nthe sole occupant of the dwelling unit, the lease is considered terminated and the landlord \n\ndoes not need to file an unlawful detainer action to obtain possession. The estate is liable \n\nfor actual damages described in Virginia Code Section 55-248.35. It is important to \n\nimmediately secure the leased premises.  Pictures or an inventory may be useful should \n\nthere be any allegations of missing or stolen property in the future.  Once the leased \n\npremises have been secured and protected, then landlord should check with the Court to \n\nsee if an executor or an administrator has been appointed to handle the probate.  If no one \n\nhas been appointed, the landlord must give at least 10 days\u2019 written notice to the \n\nemergency contact person identified in the lease or in any other related document, or if no \n\nsuch person is identified, then to the deceased tenant pursuant to Virginia Code Section \n\n55-248.6.  The notice must include a statement that all personal property items will be \n\n\n\nPage 16 of 24 \n\n \n\ntreated as abandoned in accordance with Virginia Code Section 55-248.38:1 unless \n\nclaimed within 10 days.  After the notice requirement has been satisfied, the landlord can \n\ntreat the remaining personal property as if it were abandoned and dispose of it according \n\nto Virginia Code 55-248.38:1. \n\n \n\nSTEP TEN - Acceptance of Rent During the Eviction Process  \n\n \n\nAlthough this step is not always utilized, it is critical for landlords to understand \n\nthe rules regarding the acceptance of rent during the eviction process.  Rules governing \n\nthe acceptance of rent during the eviction process are found in Virginia Code Sections \n\n55-225.47 & 55-248.34:1.  If a landlord chooses to accept the tenant\u2019s rent following the \n\nissuance of a notice to the tenant that the lease is in breach and that the landlord intends \n\nto pursue legal action, the landlord must also give written notice to the tenant that the rent \n\nis and will be accepted with reservation.  The notice may be included in the termination \n\nnotice given by the landlord to the tenant, or in a separate written notice given by the \n\nlandlord to the tenant.  If so done, no further or subsequent notice of the landlord\u2019s \n\nacceptance of rent with reservation need be given by the landlord to the tenant, which \n\nincludes the following of the Court\u2019s entry of judgment for possession but prior to the \n\neviction.  Thus, the notice need only be given once in order to secure the landlord\u2019s right \n\nto continue receiving and to accepting rent as well as to continue pursuing possession of \n\nthe leased premises.  (See 2018 amendments to Virginia Code Sections 55-225.47 & 55-\n\n248.34:1) \n\n \n\nIn Virginia, tenants are permitted to invoke a one right of redemption during a 12-\n\nmonth period.

Mail carriers may report to the staff when a given residence \n\nreceives large amounts of mail to an unauthorized person within the leased \n\npremises.  Property managers should also look for unregistered vehicles \n\nparked in the housing community lot. \n\n \n\n\uf0b7 Example 4:  Failure to maintain utilities and services \n\n \n\no Tenants generally maintain the utilities as a necessity for sustainable \n\nliving. In some cases, tenants may fail to maintain the proper utilities.  \n\nLandlords and property managers should move quickly against such \n\n\n\nPage 3 of 24 \n\n \n\ntenants to avoid property damage, especially in extreme weather \n\nconditions. \n\n \n\nQuestions:   \n\n \n\n1)   Can a landlord change the locks on the apartment and lock the tenant out \n\nfollowing a breach of the lease? \n\n \n\nAbsolutely not.  Virginia Code Sections 55-225.1 and 55-248.36 expressly \n\nprohibit the landlord from recovering possession except by lawful and permitted \n\nmeans.  Consequently, Virginia law no longer recognizes the right of \u201cself-help\u201d \n\nin residential landlord and tenant situations. Self-help remedies are still available \n\nin non-residential tenancies. (See Va. Code \u00a7 55-225) \n\n \n\n2)   Can a landlord dispose of the tenant\u2019s furniture following a breach of the \n\nlease and/or apparent abandonment?   \n\n \n\nItems of personal property left in the leased premises at the end of the tenancy are \n\nto be treated as abandoned property, which will require the landlord to comply \n\nwith Virginia Code Section 55-248.38:1.  In such a scenario, prior to disposing of \n\nany abandoned property, including furniture, the landlord must provide the former \n\nresident with the appropriate notice as set forth under the aforementioned code \n\nsection.  If possession was obtained by lawful Court order and by way of a writ of \n\neviction, then the personal property may be disposed of in accordance with"}, {"attributes": {}, "file_id": "file-MwB1RVz4McQuBEx4QxxGd4", "filename": "Virginia-Month-to-Month-Rental-Agreement.pdf", "score": 0.19956216307680105, "text": "https://legaltemplates.net/\n\n\n \n\n37.

A high occupancy rate equates to a high cash inflow.  \n\nTherefore, in general, eviction is not a welcome procedure as the eviction of a tenant \n\nresults in a vacancy and a loss of expected revenue.  Nonetheless, when a tenant is \n\nunwilling or unable to abide by the terms of a lease agreement, the tenant must be \n\nremoved quickly and efficiently.  Non-paying and problem tenants make property \n\nmanagement difficult and frustrating.  A protracted eviction process will result in lost \n\npotential revenue and lost opportunity costs.  In those situations, a clean and quick \n\neviction process is an important and helpful tool for landlords.  During the course of an \n\neviction, issues of outstanding rent, late fees, damages, and attorneys\u2019 fees will be sought \n\nand disputed by the respective parties.  This outline will review how these issues are \n\naddressed under applicable Virginia law. \n\n \n\n Please note that there are exceptions as to what properties are covered by the \n\nVirginia Residential Landlord and Tenant Act (\u201cVRLTA\u201d).\n1\n   However, with the \n\nreduction of the trigger number under Virginia Code Section 55-248.3:1(B), the majority \n\nof residential leases will now be covered by the VRLTA.  Further, in recent legislative \n\nsessions, the General Assembly has begun placing multiple sections of the VRLTA into \n\nthe Landlord and Tenant Act\n2\n, which has significantly reduced the differences between \n\nthe two Acts.  Therefore, this outline will focus primarily on the eviction process for \n\nVRLTA properties. Although there are still remaining differences between the VRLTA \n\nand the Landlord and Tenant Act, the VRLTA is more comprehensive and more often \n\nrelied upon and referred to in unlawful detainer actions than the Landlord and Tenant \n\nAct.  Thus, the VRLTA will be the main focus and subject of this outline and CLE \n\ncourse.  Differences between the two Acts will be noted along each step of the guide. \n\n \n\nSTEP ONE - Identify a Breach of the Lease \n\n \n\nProperty managers and landlords often articulate problems created by tenants, but \n\nthey routinely fail to link the tenant\u2019s behavior with a particular lease provision or \n\napplicable statute.  Property managers and landlords must be instructed to identify the \n\n                                                        \n1\n Virginia Code Sections 55-248.2 through 55-248.40. \n\n2\n Virginia Code Sections 55-217 through 55-248. \n\n\n\nPage 2 of 24 \n\n \n\nprecise nature of the breach, and they have to be instructed to detail the underlying breach \n\nin the subject notice.  \n\n \n\nThe following are common examples of instances whereby a tenant breaches a \n\nlease agreement or statutory provision: \n\n \n\n\uf0b7 Example 1:  Failure to pay rent \n\n \n\no Although one would assume that landlords quickly address tenants who"}, {"attributes": {}, "file_id": "file-4LQzSWD1z411ZwNa8KTiQB", "filename": "PMX_HANDOUT_WED_Unlawful-Detainer_Grimes_Creasy.pdf", "score": 0.18005944153602274, "text": "parked in the housing community lot. \n\n \n\n\uf0b7 Example 4:  Failure to maintain utilities and services \n\n \n\no Tenants generally maintain the utilities as a necessity for sustainable \n\nliving. In some cases, tenants may fail to maintain the proper utilities.  \n\nLandlords and property managers should move quickly against such \n\n\n\nPage 3 of 24 \n\n \n\ntenants to avoid property damage, especially in extreme weather \n\nconditions. \n\n \n\nQuestions:   \n\n \n\n1)   Can a landlord change the locks on the apartment and lock the tenant out \n\nfollowing a breach of the lease? \n\n \n\nAbsolutely not.  Virginia Code Sections 55-225.1 and 55-248.36 expressly \n\nprohibit the landlord from recovering possession except by lawful and permitted \n\nmeans.  Consequently, Virginia law no longer recognizes the right of \u201cself-help\u201d \n\nin residential landlord and tenant situations. Self-help remedies are still available \n\nin non-residential tenancies. (See Va. Code \u00a7 55-225) \n\n \n\n2)   Can a landlord dispose of the tenant\u2019s furniture following a breach of the \n\nlease and/or apparent abandonment?   \n\n \n\nItems of personal property left in the leased premises at the end of the tenancy are \n\nto be treated as abandoned property, which will require the landlord to comply \n\nwith Virginia Code Section 55-248.38:1.  In such a scenario, prior to disposing of \n\nany abandoned property, including furniture, the landlord must provide the former \n\nresident with the appropriate notice as set forth under the aforementioned code \n\nsection.  If possession was obtained by lawful Court order and by way of a writ of \n\neviction, then the personal property may be disposed of in accordance with \n\nVirginia Code Section 55-248.38:2.  Also please refer to Step Nine for additional \n\ninformation. \n\n \n\nSTEP TWO - Serve the Proper Notice  \n\n \n\nUnder the VRLTA, notices are an integral part of a good landlord-tenant practice.  \n\nPursuant to Virginia Code Section 55-248.6, the VRLTA deems notice of a fact when a \n\nperson: \n\n \n\no has actual knowledge of a fact, or \n\no has received verbal notice of the fact, or  \n\no has reason to know that such a fact exists.   \n\n \n\nThe VRLTA defines \u201cNotice\u201d as one: \n\n \n\no given in writing by either regular mail or hand delivery, with the sender \n\nretaining sufficient proof of having given such notice, which may be either \n\na United States postal certificate of mailing or a certificate of service \n\nconfirming such mailing prepared by sender; or  \n\no if the rental agreement so provides, notice may be sent in electronic form. \n\n(See Virginia Code Section 55-248.6(B)) \n\n \n\n\n\nPage 4 of 24 \n\n \n\nNotice is served on the landlord at his place of business where the lease \n\nagreement was made or at any place the landlord represents to be a place for receipt of \n\ncommunication.  Notice is served on the tenant at his last known place of residence, \n\nwhich may be the dwelling unit.  Notice received by an organization is effective for a \n\nparticular transaction at the time it is brought to the attention of the person conducting the \n\ntransaction, or from the time it would have been brought to his attention if the \n\norganization had exercised reasonable diligence.   \n\n \n\nNo notice to quit or notice of termination of tenancy served on a public housing \n\ntenant is effective unless it contains on the first page, the name, address, and telephone"}, {"attributes": {}, "file_id": "file-4LQzSWD1z411ZwNa8KTiQB", "filename": "PMX_HANDOUT_WED_Unlawful-Detainer_Grimes_Creasy.pdf", "score": 0.17356283400956238, "text": "STEP FOUR - File the Unlawful Detainer \n\n \n\nAn unlawful detainer is filed pursuant to Virginia Code Sections 8.01-124 and \n\n8.01-126.\n7\n  The forms are available on the Virginia Judicial System website.\n\n8\n  The proper \n\npleading for an eviction is an unlawful detainer and NOT a warrant in debt. \n\n \n\nThe pleading must indicate the basis for filing the unlawful detainer action.  If the \n\nbasis for the unlawful detainer action is unpaid rent, then list all amounts due and owing, \n\nincluding, but not limited to, rent, past due rent charges, fees, and attorneys\u2019 fees.  Note:  \n\nThe form was updated in July 2014 and now includes a box for \u201cPlaintiff requests \n\njudgment for all amounts due as of the date of the hearing.\u201d  You will want to always \n\ncheck that box as it will allow you to amend the amount of rent and other damages you \n\nmay be seeking without necessarily filing a motion for leave to amend.

The following information must be included on the unlawful \n\ndetainer:   \n\n \n\n\uf0b7 Proper jurisdiction \u2013 the location of the leased premises; \n\n\uf0b7 The address of the leased premises; \n\n\uf0b7 Proper party names; \n\n\uf0b7 Rent, past due rent, and fees allegedly owed by defendant to plaintiff; and \n\n\uf0b7 If the lease or the VRLTA provides for attorneys\u2019 fees, then indicate it on the \n\nunlawful detainer. \n\n \n\nQuestions: \n\n \n\n1) Should a landlord file an unlawful detainer action when it appears that the \n\nresident has abandoned the property? \n\n \n\nIf the landlord can establish that the resident has abandoned the property and has \n\nsurrendered possession of it per Virginia Code Section 55-248.33, which may require the \n\nservice of a seven (7) day abandonment notice, then the landlord does not need to file an \n\nunlawful detainer action because possession has already been re-established by the \n\nlandlord.  On the other hand, if the landlord is unable to determine whether or not the \n\nproperty has been abandoned and thus whether or not possession has been surrendered, \n\nthen the landlord should file an unlawful detainer action and allow for the Court to \n\ndetermine who has the right of possession.   \n\n \n\n2)   Does a landlord have to wait for the termination period to expire before \n\nfiling an unlawful detainer?   \n\n \n\nYes.  Once the landlord serves the appropriate termination notice as set forth under \n\nVirginia Code Section 55-248.31, then the landlord must wait until that termination \n\nperiod expires before the landlord proceeds with an unlawful detainer action.  The \n\nresident is not unlawfully detaining the unit while the notice remains in effect.  Once the \n\nnotice expires and the resident has refused to vacate and to surrender possession of the \n\nleased premises, then the landlord may argue and allege that the resident is unlawfully \n\ndetaining the unit, which will permit the landlord to proceed with the filing of a summons"}, {"attributes": {}, "file_id": "file-4LQzSWD1z411ZwNa8KTiQB", "filename": "PMX_HANDOUT_WED_Unlawful-Detainer_Grimes_Creasy.pdf", "score": 0.1677274997752162, "text": "serving the tenant for whom you may not have any contact information). \n\n \n\n As briefly noted Step Six, since 2005, Virginia Code Section 8.01-128 has \n\nallowed a plaintiff to bifurcate the unlawful detainer action as to possession and damages.  \n\n\n\nPage 18 of 24 \n\n \n\nThis allows a landlord to capture more damages in a single unlawful detainer action.  The \n\nhearing on damages must be held within 120 days of the hearing on possession.  \n\nHowever, the 120-day period should capture the significant majority, if not all, of a \n\nlandlord\u2019s damages.  Before the damages hearing, the landlord will have possession of \n\nthe premises and will be able to fully assess any damage above normal wear and tear.  \n\nFurthermore, if the landlord is able to re-rent the leased premises during that time period \n\nthen that turnover period, in which no rent was received, can be claimed as outstanding \n\nrent.  If the premises are still not re-rented, then at least the landlord can claim the entire \n\n120-day window.  Keep in mind, however, that the landlord must make a good-faith \n\neffort to mitigate the damages, which would include standard business efforts to re-rent \n\nthe premises.   \n\n \n\nLate Fees \n\n \n\n Virginia Code Section 55-248.7 specifically authorizes a landlord to charge a fee \n\nfor a tenant\u2019s late payments, although it does not specify an amount.  Courts will \n\nnormally view late fees as a matter of contract law and will strictly construe the statutory \n\nlanguage, allowing for reasonable \u201clate charges contracted for in a written rental \n\nagreement.\u201d  However, Courts will weigh the reasonableness of assessed late fees.  \n\nGenerally, Courts will approve a late fee of up to 10% of the monthly rent. \n\n \n\nCosts \n \n\n While \u201ccosts\u201d may sound like a broad category of damages, it only applies to the \n\ncost of filing and service of process by the local sheriff.  Typically, the cost of filing an \n\nunlawful detainer action ranges from $50-$70; whereas the cost for service of process by \n\na sheriff is currently $12.  Therefore, the \u201ccosts\u201d area of recovery is quite limited. \n\n \n\nReasonable Attorneys\u2019 Fees \n\n \n\n Similar to late fees, the VRLTA includes various sections that allow the landlord \n\nrecovery of attorneys\u2019 fees with no other guidance except that they must be \u201creasonable.\u201d  \n\nIn smaller, more \u201crun of the mill\u201d unlawful detainer actions, Courts will generally \n\napprove attorneys\u2019 fees as a reasonable percentage (usually 25%-33%) of the judgment \n\nawarded.  However, in larger, more complex litigation, Courts may require proof of \n\nactual attorney fees incurred.  Note:  A landlord cannot include or add charges for \n\nattorneys\u2019 fees without actually retaining and having an attorney present at the hearing. \n\n \n\nActual Damages \n\n \n\n Rent and late fees are the most straightforward actual damages in that the amounts \n\nare specified in the lease agreement.  However, the Landlord can recover for other \n\ndamages actually incurred.  Most commonly, such damages will be repairs to the \n\npremises for damages incurred above normal wear and tear.  As noted in Step Five, if a \n\nparticular item in the leased premises is damaged and requires repair, then the landlord \n\ncan recover the actual cost of repair.  If the item must be replaced, however, then the \n\n\n\nPage 19 of 24"}, {"attributes": {}, "file_id": "file-4LQzSWD1z411ZwNa8KTiQB", "filename": "PMX_HANDOUT_WED_Unlawful-Detainer_Grimes_Creasy.pdf", "score": 0.16513168380948964, "text": "information. \n\n \n\nSTEP TWO - Serve the Proper Notice  \n\n \n\nUnder the VRLTA, notices are an integral part of a good landlord-tenant practice.  \n\nPursuant to Virginia Code Section 55-248.6, the VRLTA deems notice of a fact when a \n\nperson: \n\n \n\no has actual knowledge of a fact, or \n\no has received verbal notice of the fact, or  \n\no has reason to know that such a fact exists.   \n\n \n\nThe VRLTA defines \u201cNotice\u201d as one: \n\n \n\no given in writing by either regular mail or hand delivery, with the sender \n\nretaining sufficient proof of having given such notice, which may be either \n\na United States postal certificate of mailing or a certificate of service \n\nconfirming such mailing prepared by sender; or  \n\no if the rental agreement so provides, notice may be sent in electronic form. \n\n(See Virginia Code Section 55-248.6(B)) \n\n \n\n\n\nPage 4 of 24 \n\n \n\nNotice is served on the landlord at his place of business where the lease \n\nagreement was made or at any place the landlord represents to be a place for receipt of \n\ncommunication.

Here are some key points regarding rentals in Virginia:\n\n1. **Rental Agreements**: Rental agreements can be established through written or verbal contracts, but it is advisable to have a written lease for clarity. Most standard leases in Virginia are month-to-month, meaning they continue until either party gives appropriate notice to terminate.\n\n2. **Rent Payments**: Rent is typically paid monthly and can be calculated on a pro-rata basis if the rental period is shorter than a month. Landlords may charge late fees if rent is not paid on time, although the law does not specify an exact percentage .\n\n3. **Security Deposits**: A security deposit, usually equivalent to one month\u2019s rent, may be required and should be returned to the tenant after the lease ends, provided no damages exceed normal wear and tear. \n\n4. **Tenant Responsibilities**: Tenants are responsible for keeping the premises clean and in good condition. Any damages beyond normal wear and tear may lead to deductions from the security deposit .\n\n5. **Property Maintenance and Repairs**: Landlords are required to maintain the property in a livable condition, which includes making necessary repairs. Tenants should notify landlords promptly of any issues needing attention.\n\n6. **Eviction Process**: If a tenant fails to pay rent or breaches the lease, landlords must follow a legally defined eviction process called unlawful detainer. This includes notifying the tenant of their breach and allowing a specific period for them to remedy it before proceeding with eviction  .\n\n7. **Lead-Based Paint Disclosure**: For properties built before 1978, landlords must disclose any known lead-based paint hazards.\n\nUnderstanding these elements can aid both tenants and landlords in navigating the rental landscape in Virginia effectively.", "type": "output_text"}], "role": "assistant", "status": "completed", "type": "message"}], "parallel_tool_calls": true, "temperature": 1.0, "tool_choice": "auto", "tools": [{"type": "file_search", "vector_store_ids": ["vs_67de4b77da408191a27778cece947dc2"], "filters": null, "max_num_results": 20, "ranking_options": {"ranker": "auto", "score_threshold": 0.0}}], "top_p": 1.0, "max_output_tokens": null, "previous_response_id": null, "reasoning": {"effort": null, "generate_summary": null}, "status": "completed", "text": {"format": {"type": "text"}}, "truncation": "disabled", "usage": {"input_tokens": 17543, "input_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 0}, "output_tokens": 477, "output_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 0}, "total_tokens": 18020}, "user": null, "store": true}}, {"question": "What are the duties of a landlord?", "response": {"id": "resp_67df9fefc3488192a9ff5d498fb40f6a0a33779ed8685c87", "created_at": 1742708719.0, "error": null, "incomplete_details": null, "instructions": null, "metadata": {}, "model": "gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18", "object": "response", "output": [{"id": "fs_67df9ff09cd8819286dd460f64e8d6890a33779ed8685c87", "queries": ["What are the duties of a landlord?", "landlord responsibilities", "landlord duties"], "status": "completed", "type": "file_search_call", "results": [{"attributes": {}, "file_id": "file-4LQzSWD1z411ZwNa8KTiQB", "filename": "PMX_HANDOUT_WED_Unlawful-Detainer_Grimes_Creasy.pdf", "score": 0.7821241343807586, "text": "tenant in the premises or in any storage area provided by the landlord.

Landlord\u2019s often accept a partial payment and hope that the \n\ntenant\u2019s next payment will be for the full amount owed.  Once a tenant \n\nstarts to fall behind, non-payment usually follows, which becomes \n\ncompounded with the imposition of late fees. Thus, landlords should \n\nadhere to a consistent policy of sending notices unless they receive the full \n\nrent amount.   \n\n \n\n\uf0b7 Example 2:  Breach of quiet enjoyment \n\n \n\no Well written leases contain a provision requiring that a tenant respect the \n\nquiet enjoyment of the leased premises and common areas.  Situations \n\noften arise whereby tenants cause disturbances disrupting other tenants.  \n\nPractitioners should encourage their landlord/property manager clients to \n\ndocument any such incidents.  Thorough documentation will make success \n\nduring the trial phase more likely.  Landlords should send 21/30 material \n\nnon-compliance notices following such a breach. The number of 21/30 \n\nnotices to be sent prior to filling a Summons for Unlawful Detainer is \n\nusually dictated by the severity of the breach. \n\n \n\n\uf0b7 Example 3:  Failure to abide by occupancy restrictions \n\n \n\no Most leases require the prospect to list individuals, who will be living on \n\nthe premises.  Many leases also require that only those individuals listed in \n\nthe lease reside on the premises.  On occasion, tenants will permit \n\nunauthorized friends and family to move into the leased premises.  These \n\nsituations are difficult for property managers and landlords to detect and to \n\nprove. Mail carriers may report to the staff when a given residence \n\nreceives large amounts of mail to an unauthorized person within the leased \n\npremises.  Property managers should also look for unregistered vehicles \n\nparked in the housing community lot. \n\n \n\n\uf0b7 Example 4:  Failure to maintain utilities and services \n\n \n\no Tenants generally maintain the utilities as a necessity for sustainable \n\nliving. In some cases, tenants may fail to maintain the proper utilities.  \n\nLandlords and property managers should move quickly against such \n\n\n\nPage 3 of 24 \n\n \n\ntenants to avoid property damage, especially in extreme weather \n\nconditions. \n\n \n\nQuestions:   \n\n \n\n1)   Can a landlord change the locks on the apartment and lock the tenant out \n\nfollowing a breach of the lease? \n\n \n\nAbsolutely not.  Virginia Code Sections 55-225.1 and 55-248.36 expressly \n\nprohibit the landlord from recovering possession except by lawful and permitted \n\nmeans.  Consequently, Virginia law no longer recognizes the right of \u201cself-help\u201d \n\nin residential landlord and tenant situations. Self-help remedies are still available \n\nin non-residential tenancies. (See Va. Code \u00a7 55-225) \n\n \n\n2)   Can a landlord dispose of the tenant\u2019s furniture following a breach of the \n\nlease and/or apparent abandonment?   \n\n \n\nItems of personal property left in the leased premises at the end of the tenancy are \n\nto be treated as abandoned property, which will require the landlord to comply \n\nwith Virginia Code Section 55-248.38:1.  In such a scenario, prior to disposing of \n\nany abandoned property, including furniture, the landlord must provide the former \n\nresident with the appropriate notice as set forth under the aforementioned code \n\nsection.  If possession was obtained by lawful Court order and by way of a writ of \n\neviction, then the personal property may be disposed of in accordance with"}, {"attributes": {}, "file_id": "file-4LQzSWD1z411ZwNa8KTiQB", "filename": "PMX_HANDOUT_WED_Unlawful-Detainer_Grimes_Creasy.pdf", "score": 0.6960823687672298, "text": "2) execute the writ of possession and store the personal property in a storage area \n\ndesignated by the landlord (which can be the leased premises itself) for 24 hours \n\nand then dispose of it.  \n\n  \n\nIf the landlord chooses the storage area option, the tenant must be provided access, at \n\nreasonable times, to the personal property until the landlord disposes of it.

The estate is liable \n\nfor actual damages described in Virginia Code Section 55-248.35. It is important to \n\nimmediately secure the leased premises.

Rules governing \n\nthe acceptance of rent during the eviction process are found in Virginia Code Sections \n\n55-225.47 & 55-248.34:1.  If a landlord chooses to accept the tenant\u2019s rent following the \n\nissuance of a notice to the tenant that the lease is in breach and that the landlord intends \n\nto pursue legal action, the landlord must also give written notice to the tenant that the rent \n\nis and will be accepted with reservation.  The notice may be included in the termination \n\nnotice given by the landlord to the tenant, or in a separate written notice given by the \n\nlandlord to the tenant.  If so done, no further or subsequent notice of the landlord\u2019s \n\nacceptance of rent with reservation need be given by the landlord to the tenant, which \n\nincludes the following of the Court\u2019s entry of judgment for possession but prior to the \n\neviction.  Thus, the notice need only be given once in order to secure the landlord\u2019s right \n\nto continue receiving and to accepting rent as well as to continue pursuing possession of \n\nthe leased premises.  (See 2018 amendments to Virginia Code Sections 55-225.47 & 55-\n\n248.34:1) \n\n \n\nIn Virginia, tenants are permitted to invoke a one right of redemption during a 12-\n\nmonth period.

A high occupancy rate equates to a high cash inflow.  \n\nTherefore, in general, eviction is not a welcome procedure as the eviction of a tenant \n\nresults in a vacancy and a loss of expected revenue.  Nonetheless, when a tenant is \n\nunwilling or unable to abide by the terms of a lease agreement, the tenant must be \n\nremoved quickly and efficiently.  Non-paying and problem tenants make property \n\nmanagement difficult and frustrating.  A protracted eviction process will result in lost \n\npotential revenue and lost opportunity costs.  In those situations, a clean and quick \n\neviction process is an important and helpful tool for landlords.  During the course of an \n\neviction, issues of outstanding rent, late fees, damages, and attorneys\u2019 fees will be sought \n\nand disputed by the respective parties.  This outline will review how these issues are \n\naddressed under applicable Virginia law. \n\n \n\n Please note that there are exceptions as to what properties are covered by the \n\nVirginia Residential Landlord and Tenant Act (\u201cVRLTA\u201d).\n1\n   However, with the \n\nreduction of the trigger number under Virginia Code Section 55-248.3:1(B), the majority \n\nof residential leases will now be covered by the VRLTA.  Further, in recent legislative \n\nsessions, the General Assembly has begun placing multiple sections of the VRLTA into \n\nthe Landlord and Tenant Act\n2\n, which has significantly reduced the differences between \n\nthe two Acts.  Therefore, this outline will focus primarily on the eviction process for \n\nVRLTA properties. Although there are still remaining differences between the VRLTA \n\nand the Landlord and Tenant Act, the VRLTA is more comprehensive and more often \n\nrelied upon and referred to in unlawful detainer actions than the Landlord and Tenant \n\nAct.  Thus, the VRLTA will be the main focus and subject of this outline and CLE \n\ncourse.  Differences between the two Acts will be noted along each step of the guide. \n\n \n\nSTEP ONE - Identify a Breach of the Lease \n\n \n\nProperty managers and landlords often articulate problems created by tenants, but \n\nthey routinely fail to link the tenant\u2019s behavior with a particular lease provision or \n\napplicable statute.  Property managers and landlords must be instructed to identify the \n\n                                                        \n1\n Virginia Code Sections 55-248.2 through 55-248.40. \n\n2\n Virginia Code Sections 55-217 through 55-248. \n\n\n\nPage 2 of 24 \n\n \n\nprecise nature of the breach, and they have to be instructed to detail the underlying breach \n\nin the subject notice.  \n\n \n\nThe following are common examples of instances whereby a tenant breaches a \n\nlease agreement or statutory provision: \n\n \n\n\uf0b7 Example 1:  Failure to pay rent \n\n \n\no Although one would assume that landlords quickly address tenants who"}, {"attributes": {}, "file_id": "file-4LQzSWD1z411ZwNa8KTiQB", "filename": "PMX_HANDOUT_WED_Unlawful-Detainer_Grimes_Creasy.pdf", "score": 0.6524370031947991, "text": "serving the tenant for whom you may not have any contact information). \n\n \n\n As briefly noted Step Six, since 2005, Virginia Code Section 8.01-128 has \n\nallowed a plaintiff to bifurcate the unlawful detainer action as to possession and damages.  \n\n\n\nPage 18 of 24 \n\n \n\nThis allows a landlord to capture more damages in a single unlawful detainer action.  The \n\nhearing on damages must be held within 120 days of the hearing on possession.  \n\nHowever, the 120-day period should capture the significant majority, if not all, of a \n\nlandlord\u2019s damages.  Before the damages hearing, the landlord will have possession of \n\nthe premises and will be able to fully assess any damage above normal wear and tear.  \n\nFurthermore, if the landlord is able to re-rent the leased premises during that time period \n\nthen that turnover period, in which no rent was received, can be claimed as outstanding \n\nrent.  If the premises are still not re-rented, then at least the landlord can claim the entire \n\n120-day window.  Keep in mind, however, that the landlord must make a good-faith \n\neffort to mitigate the damages, which would include standard business efforts to re-rent \n\nthe premises.   \n\n \n\nLate Fees \n\n \n\n Virginia Code Section 55-248.7 specifically authorizes a landlord to charge a fee \n\nfor a tenant\u2019s late payments, although it does not specify an amount.  Courts will \n\nnormally view late fees as a matter of contract law and will strictly construe the statutory \n\nlanguage, allowing for reasonable \u201clate charges contracted for in a written rental \n\nagreement.\u201d  However, Courts will weigh the reasonableness of assessed late fees.  \n\nGenerally, Courts will approve a late fee of up to 10% of the monthly rent. \n\n \n\nCosts \n \n\n While \u201ccosts\u201d may sound like a broad category of damages, it only applies to the \n\ncost of filing and service of process by the local sheriff.  Typically, the cost of filing an \n\nunlawful detainer action ranges from $50-$70; whereas the cost for service of process by \n\na sheriff is currently $12.  Therefore, the \u201ccosts\u201d area of recovery is quite limited. \n\n \n\nReasonable Attorneys\u2019 Fees \n\n \n\n Similar to late fees, the VRLTA includes various sections that allow the landlord \n\nrecovery of attorneys\u2019 fees with no other guidance except that they must be \u201creasonable.\u201d  \n\nIn smaller, more \u201crun of the mill\u201d unlawful detainer actions, Courts will generally \n\napprove attorneys\u2019 fees as a reasonable percentage (usually 25%-33%) of the judgment \n\nawarded.  However, in larger, more complex litigation, Courts may require proof of \n\nactual attorney fees incurred.  Note:  A landlord cannot include or add charges for \n\nattorneys\u2019 fees without actually retaining and having an attorney present at the hearing. \n\n \n\nActual Damages \n\n \n\n Rent and late fees are the most straightforward actual damages in that the amounts \n\nare specified in the lease agreement.  However, the Landlord can recover for other \n\ndamages actually incurred.  Most commonly, such damages will be repairs to the \n\npremises for damages incurred above normal wear and tear.  As noted in Step Five, if a \n\nparticular item in the leased premises is damaged and requires repair, then the landlord \n\ncan recover the actual cost of repair.  If the item must be replaced, however, then the \n\n\n\nPage 19 of 24"}, {"attributes": {}, "file_id": "file-4LQzSWD1z411ZwNa8KTiQB", "filename": "PMX_HANDOUT_WED_Unlawful-Detainer_Grimes_Creasy.pdf", "score": 0.6514055499844961, "text": "and 8.01-293.  A writ of possession may be issued up to one year following the date of \n\njudgment for possession, and the writ of possession must be returnable within 30 days \n\nfrom the date of issuing the writ.  Note: Courts should only award \u201cimmediate\u201d \n\npossession in the event of default judgments, for cases of nonpayment of rent, and for \n\nimmediate non-remediable breaches of the lease. \n\n \n\nThe landlord or property manager will not be permitted to issue a writ if he has \n\naccepted rent payments without reservation.   (See Virginia Code Sections 8.01-471 and \n\n55-248.34:1).  The request for a writ of possession must be filed with the clerk\u2019s office \n\nand the clerk must be provided with three copies of the writ of possession.  As stated in \n\nVirginia Code Section 8.01-293, only the sheriff may execute the writ.  The sheriff will \n\ntravel to the leased premises and physically remove the tenant from the premises. This \n\nstep actually results in the removal of the tenant and effectively closes the eviction \n\nprocess.  Note: The sheriff will maintain the peace, but he or she will not remove the \n\ntenant\u2019s personal property or anything else that needs to be removed from the premises.  \n\nIf you anticipate having to remove any personal property belongings located in the unit, \n\nyou then should be prepared to have those belonging removed pursuant to Virginia Code \n\nSection 55-248.38:2 as described below. \n\n \n\nPersonal Property Issues \n\n \n\n As briefly noted in Step One, following the termination of the lease (not following \n\nthe execution of a writ of possession), Virginia Code Section 55-248.38:1 describes how \n\na landlord can handle the disposal of personal property items that were abandoned by the \n\ntenant in the premises or in any storage area provided by the landlord.  The landlord must \n\ngive the tenant notice by: \n\n \n\n\n\nPage 15 of 24 \n\n \n\n1) Providing a termination notice that includes a statement that any \n\npersonal property left in the premises will be disposed of within the 24-\n\nhour period after termination of the lease; \n\n2) Providing written notice pursuant to Section 55-248.33 that includes a \n\nstatement that all personal property left in the premises will be disposed \n\nof within the 24-hour period after the seven-day notice period expires; \n\nor  \n\n3) Providing separate written notice to tenant that all personal property left \n\nin the premises will be disposed of within 24 hours of the ten (10) day \n\nnotice period expires. \n\n \n\nIt is important to note that the landlord must allow the tenant reasonable access to the \n\nproperty until the time in which the property is disposed.  What that means in practice is \n\nthat, once any statutory notice period has expired, the landlord should promptly dispose \n\nof the personal property.  If the landlord waits and denies the tenant\u2019s request for \n\nreasonable access to the personal property even after the required wait period has expired, \n\nthen the tenant is entitled to injunctive relief and other relief provided by law (typically \n\ndamages for the value of the personal property being detained.) \n\n \n\n Virginia Code Section 55-248-38:2 provides how a landlord may treat personal \n\nproperty remaining in the premises following a judgment for possession in an unlawful \n\ndetainer action.  The statute provides the landlord with two options:  \n\n \n\n1) execute the writ of possession and remove the personal property to the nearest \n\npublic way for 24 hours after which the landlord must dispose of the property; or"}, {"attributes": {}, "file_id": "file-4LQzSWD1z411ZwNa8KTiQB", "filename": "PMX_HANDOUT_WED_Unlawful-Detainer_Grimes_Creasy.pdf", "score": 0.6344199050304137, "text": "information. \n\n \n\nSTEP TWO - Serve the Proper Notice  \n\n \n\nUnder the VRLTA, notices are an integral part of a good landlord-tenant practice.  \n\nPursuant to Virginia Code Section 55-248.6, the VRLTA deems notice of a fact when a \n\nperson: \n\n \n\no has actual knowledge of a fact, or \n\no has received verbal notice of the fact, or  \n\no has reason to know that such a fact exists.   \n\n \n\nThe VRLTA defines \u201cNotice\u201d as one: \n\n \n\no given in writing by either regular mail or hand delivery, with the sender \n\nretaining sufficient proof of having given such notice, which may be either \n\na United States postal certificate of mailing or a certificate of service \n\nconfirming such mailing prepared by sender; or  \n\no if the rental agreement so provides, notice may be sent in electronic form. \n\n(See Virginia Code Section 55-248.6(B)) \n\n \n\n\n\nPage 4 of 24 \n\n \n\nNotice is served on the landlord at his place of business where the lease \n\nagreement was made or at any place the landlord represents to be a place for receipt of \n\ncommunication.  Notice is served on the tenant at his last known place of residence, \n\nwhich may be the dwelling unit.  Notice received by an organization is effective for a \n\nparticular transaction at the time it is brought to the attention of the person conducting the \n\ntransaction, or from the time it would have been brought to his attention if the \n\norganization had exercised reasonable diligence.   \n\n \n\nNo notice to quit or notice of termination of tenancy served on a public housing \n\ntenant is effective unless it contains on the first page, the name, address, and telephone \n\nnumber of the legal services program, if any, serving the jurisdiction in which the rental \n\npremises are located.  \n\n \n\nNotices must set forth the proper time periods permitting the tenant an \n\nopportunity to remedy his breach or a statutory time period within which to surrender \n\npossession of the premises, as required by the VRLTA.  If the property is governed by \n\nHUD such as a Section 8 based property, the notices must also strictly comply with the \n\napplicable HUD regulations and guidelines. \n\n \n\nExamples:  \n\n \n\nExample 1:  21/30 Material Non-Compliance Notice  \n\n  \n\nPursuant to Virginia Code Section 55-248.31, a 21/30 material non-compliance \n\nnotice should be sent to tenants when they breach the lease in such a way that the breach \n\ncould be remedied and cured.\n3\n   \n\n \n\nFor example, assume a hypothetical situation whereby neighbors complain about \n\na particular tenant\u2019s loud and disturbing behavior, to which the landlord may send this \n\nnotice to indicate that the tenant has 21 days within which to remedy his breach of the \n\nlease for his failure to comply with the lease\u2019s quiet enjoyment provision.  Should the \n\nlandlord receive any further verifiable complaints within 21 days, the tenant must vacate \n\nthe premises within 30 days from the date of the notice.  On the other hand, if the tenant \n\ndoes not violate the quiet enjoyment provision, then he may remain on the premises \n\nthrough the duration of the lease term, provided there are no other breaches of the lease.   \n\n \n\nExample 2:   Material Non-Compliance for Failure to Pay Rent  \n\n \n\nPursuant to Virginia Code Section 55-248.31, this notice should be used when a \n\ntenant fails to pay rent.

Regardless of the nature of the damages, the landlord \n\nshould be prepared to provide receipts and testimony to the Court, detailing the damages \n\nand explaining with specificity how it was incurred.  Note:  The VRLTA does not \n\nprovide for punitive damages. \n\n \n\nRemedy by Repair \n\n \n\nIt is helpful to note that pursuant to Virginia Code Section 55-248.32, if the tenant \n\nviolates a provision of Virginia Code Section 55-248.16 (detailing tenant\u2019s duties to \n\nmaintain premises) or a provision of the lease agreement materially affecting health and \n\nsafety that can be remedied by repair, replacement, or cleaning, the landlord shall send a \n\nwritten notice to the tenant specifying the breach and stating that the landlord will enter \n\nthe dwelling unit and will perform the work in a workmanlike manner and will submit an \n\nitemized bill to the tenant for the actual and reasonable cost of the repair, which shall be \n\ndue as rent on the next rent due date, or if the rental agreement has terminated, for \n\nimmediate payment.  This section specifically authorizes the landlord to \u201cengage a third \n\nparty\u201d to perform such repairs.  In the event of an emergency, the landlord may enter the \n\npremises and repair the damage following the same procedures. \n\nCHALLENGES TO TITLE IN UNLAWFUL DETAINER ACTIONS \n\n Another recent issue that has been raised by the Virginia Supreme Court is the \n\nability of General District Courts to consider challenges to a plaintiff\u2019s title to property in \n\nan unlawful detainer action. In Parrish v. Fannie Mae, the Supreme Court held that, \n\nwhile a General District Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction to hear title challenges to \n\nreal property, the court may nonetheless consider whether such a challenge is legally \n\nsufficient to justify a dismissal without prejudice on jurisdictional grounds.  See Parrish \n\nv. Fannie Mae, 292 Va. 44, 787 S.E.2d 116 (2016)(a copy of which is attached hereto). \n\nThis holding now raises the question as to what evidence a General District Court may \n\nconsider in making such a determination.  \n\nOverview of the Parrish case   \n\n  In Parrish, the plaintiff, Fannie Mae, received a deed of trust to the defendants\u2019 \n\nreal property, and it thereafter sought to take possession of the defendants\u2019 property \n\npursuant to an unlawful detainer action in general district court. Id. at 48, 787 S.E.2d at \n\n119. The defendants responded to the unlawful detainer action by arguing that the \n\nunderlying foreclosure action was invalid due to plaintiff\u2019s failure to comply with a \n\ncondition precedent inherent in the deed of trust.  See id. The General District Court \n\nnonetheless awarded possession to Fannie Mae, and the defendants filed an appeal to the \n\nCircuit Court. Id. \n\n In the Circuit Court, Fannie Mae argued that the Court should not consider any \n\ndefenses relating to the validity of the underlying foreclosure action due to the fact that \n\n\n\nPage 20 of 24 \n\n \n\nthe General District Court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to hear a title challenge in an \n\nunlawful detainer action.

Virginia Code Sections 55-225.1 and 55-248.36 expressly \n\nprohibit the landlord from recovering possession except by lawful and permitted \n\nmeans.  Consequently, Virginia law no longer recognizes the right of \u201cself-help\u201d \n\nin residential landlord and tenant situations. Self-help remedies are still available \n\nin non-residential tenancies. (See Va.

Notice received by an organization is effective for a \n\nparticular transaction at the time it is brought to the attention of the person conducting the \n\ntransaction, or from the time it would have been brought to his attention if the \n\norganization had exercised reasonable diligence.   \n\n \n\nNo notice to quit or notice of termination of tenancy served on a public housing \n\ntenant is effective unless it contains on the first page, the name, address, and telephone"}, {"attributes": {}, "file_id": "file-4LQzSWD1z411ZwNa8KTiQB", "filename": "PMX_HANDOUT_WED_Unlawful-Detainer_Grimes_Creasy.pdf", "score": 0.6154416053557142, "text": "\uf0b7 Rent, past due rent, and fees allegedly owed by defendant to plaintiff; and \n\n\uf0b7 If the lease or the VRLTA provides for attorneys\u2019 fees, then indicate it on the \n\nunlawful detainer. \n\n \n\nQuestions: \n\n \n\n1) Should a landlord file an unlawful detainer action when it appears that the \n\nresident has abandoned the property? \n\n \n\nIf the landlord can establish that the resident has abandoned the property and has \n\nsurrendered possession of it per Virginia Code Section 55-248.33, which may require the \n\nservice of a seven (7) day abandonment notice, then the landlord does not need to file an \n\nunlawful detainer action because possession has already been re-established by the \n\nlandlord.  On the other hand, if the landlord is unable to determine whether or not the \n\nproperty has been abandoned and thus whether or not possession has been surrendered, \n\nthen the landlord should file an unlawful detainer action and allow for the Court to \n\ndetermine who has the right of possession.   \n\n \n\n2)   Does a landlord have to wait for the termination period to expire before \n\nfiling an unlawful detainer?   \n\n \n\nYes.  Once the landlord serves the appropriate termination notice as set forth under \n\nVirginia Code Section 55-248.31, then the landlord must wait until that termination \n\nperiod expires before the landlord proceeds with an unlawful detainer action.  The \n\nresident is not unlawfully detaining the unit while the notice remains in effect.  Once the \n\nnotice expires and the resident has refused to vacate and to surrender possession of the \n\nleased premises, then the landlord may argue and allege that the resident is unlawfully \n\ndetaining the unit, which will permit the landlord to proceed with the filing of a summons \n\nfor unlawful detainer seeking possession of the leased premises.   \n\n \n\nSTEP FIVE - Prepare for Common Evidentiary Issues \n\n \n\nLandlord and Tenant law is similar to other areas of contract law as the plaintiff \n\nmust show the existence of a contract, a breach, and the damages proximately caused by \n\nthe breach.  The lease serves as proof of a contract with consideration.  The ledger sheet \n\nestablishes the monetary damages.  Both of these elements are usually proven through the \n\n\n\nPage 8 of 24 \n\n \n\nproperty manager, who should, during the course of his or her testimony, identify and \n\nintroduce into evidence a copy of the lease, the account ledger, and the appropriate \n\nnotice(s).  The property manager should also be able to testify regarding the authenticity \n\nof both documents.  Most of the testimony during a landlord and tenant case revolves \n\naround establishing the breach. \n\n \n\nThe plaintiff must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the breach \n\nreferred to and identified in the notice is identical to the breach referred to on the face of \n\nthe unlawful detainer summons. The notice and the unlawful detainer summons should \n\nlist the same breach. Courts often strike evidence regarding the tenant\u2019s alleged behavior \n\nthat plaintiff failed to include in the notice or in the unlawful detainer summons. \n\n \n\nPrior to any Court appearance, the plaintiff\u2019s attorney should identify all potential \n\nevidence necessary to prove the tenant\u2019s breach of the lease. It is straightforward and \n\neasy to determine that the lease was breached for failure to pay rent on time.  It can be \n\nmore difficult to prove other breaches. To prove other types of breaches, it may be \n\nnecessary to call witnesses, who observed or documented the breach.  The property \n\nmanager, neighbors, police and/or security guards often provide helpful testimony"}, {"attributes": {}, "file_id": "file-4LQzSWD1z411ZwNa8KTiQB", "filename": "PMX_HANDOUT_WED_Unlawful-Detainer_Grimes_Creasy.pdf", "score": 0.6110761416933929, "text": "Due to the statutory requirements, it is necessary to introduce the notice into \n\nevidence and to prove that the notice was served properly, as required by Virginia Code \n\nSection 55-248.6, and that the notice was proper and addressed the specific breach that \n\noccurred in the case at bar in accordance with Section 55-248.31.   \n\n \n\nQuestions: \n\n \n\n1)    How much can a landlord deduct from the tenant\u2019s security deposit for a \n\ncarpet ruined by the tenant\u2019s pet? \n\n \n\nVirginia Code Section 55-248.15:1, subparagraph A, will permit the landlord to \n\nmake a deduction from the security deposit based on damages above reasonable \n\nwear and tear suffered as a result of the resident\u2019s noncompliance with Virginia \n\nCode Section 55-248.16.  Therefore, if the carpet has been ruined by pet urine, \n\nexcess traffic, or other such damage above reasonable wear and tear, the damage \n\ncharges can be deducted from the security deposit.  If the damage to the carpet \n\ncan be repaired without replacement, then the landlord may deduct its actual costs \n\nincurred in making the repair.  On the other hand, if the carpet has been ruined to \n\nthe extent that it must be replaced, then the landlord may not deduct the actual \n\nreplacement cost of the carpet.  Rather, the landlord may only deduct from the \n\nsecurity deposit the depreciated value of the carpet at the time of destruction.  \n\n(Please also note that, as of January 1, 2015, the statutory requirement to accrue \n\ninterest on security deposits was repealed.) \n\n    \n\n  \n\n\n\nPage 9 of 24 \n\n \n\nSTEP SIX - Prepare for and Attend the Return Date \n\n \n\nMany unlawful detainers result in default judgments, particularly in cases brought \n\nfor non-payment of rent.  Nevertheless, the plaintiff\u2019s attorney must present evidence to \n\nthe Court, which consists of the:  \n\n \n\n1. account ledger; \n\n2. 5-day notice; \n\n3. lease agreement; and \n\n4. affidavit per Virginia Code Section 8.01-126. \n\n \n\nA Court may require rent escrow before the tenant can request a continuance, \n\npursuant to Virginia Code Section 55-248.25:1.  Under Virginia Code Section 55-\n\n248.25:1, where a landlord has filed an unlawful detainer action seeking possession of the \n\npremises and the tenant seeks to obtain a continuance of the action or to set it for a \n\ncontested trial, the Court may, at that time, order the tenant to pay an amount equal to the \n\nrent due as of the initial Court date into the Court escrow account prior to granting the \n\ntenant\u2019s request for a continuance.  If the tenant asserts a \u201cgood faith defense,\u201d and the \n\nCourt agrees, the Court shall not require the rent to be escrowed.

Actual damages of the breach. \n\n \n\nPossession \n\n \n\n How to obtain possession is discussed in detail in the preceding sections of this \n\noutline.   \n\n \n\nRent \n\n \n\n Most people think of rent as simply the required monthly payment the tenant \n\nmakes as specified under the lease.  However, the VRLTA defines rent as \u201call money, \n\nother than a security deposit, owed or paid to the landlord under the rental agreement, \n\nincluding prepaid rent paid more than one month in advance of the rent due date,\u201d which \n\nbroadens rent to include other fees and damages incurred under the lease. (See Virginia \n\nCode Sections 55-248.4 and 55-248.32.)  \n\n \n\nWhile rent may seem a straightforward category of damages, there are some \n\nissues to keep in mind.  First of all, as briefly noted in the Eviction guide, the July 2014 \n\nunlawful detainer form includes a box that indicates that the plaintiff will seek rent owed \n\nas of the date of the hearing.  It is important to check that box so that you can easily \n\namend the amount of rent you are seeking (in lieu of more complicated motions for leave \n\nto amend).  However, there will always be additional rent after the first contested hearing, \n\nso how can you recover that additional rent?  There are two options a plaintiff can pursue. \n\n \n\n Before 2005, after a plaintiff has successfully completed the unlawful detainer \n\naction, he or she would have to file a warrant in debt for any rent and damages not \n\nrecovered under unlawful detainer action.  Currently, the main appeal to this method is \n\nthat the landlord has time to fully assess all of his damages and document his claim \n\naccordingly.  Additionally, certain landlords as a business model have an organizational \n\nseparation between unlawful detainers and collecting outstanding debts, for example \n\nretaining collection agencies for the latter.  The downside to that approach is that it"}, {"attributes": {}, "file_id": "file-4LQzSWD1z411ZwNa8KTiQB", "filename": "PMX_HANDOUT_WED_Unlawful-Detainer_Grimes_Creasy.pdf", "score": 0.5536462428028216, "text": "treat the remaining personal property as if it were abandoned and dispose of it according \n\nto Virginia Code 55-248.38:1. \n\n \n\nSTEP TEN - Acceptance of Rent During the Eviction Process  \n\n \n\nAlthough this step is not always utilized, it is critical for landlords to understand \n\nthe rules regarding the acceptance of rent during the eviction process.  Rules governing \n\nthe acceptance of rent during the eviction process are found in Virginia Code Sections \n\n55-225.47 & 55-248.34:1.  If a landlord chooses to accept the tenant\u2019s rent following the \n\nissuance of a notice to the tenant that the lease is in breach and that the landlord intends \n\nto pursue legal action, the landlord must also give written notice to the tenant that the rent \n\nis and will be accepted with reservation.  The notice may be included in the termination \n\nnotice given by the landlord to the tenant, or in a separate written notice given by the \n\nlandlord to the tenant.  If so done, no further or subsequent notice of the landlord\u2019s \n\nacceptance of rent with reservation need be given by the landlord to the tenant, which \n\nincludes the following of the Court\u2019s entry of judgment for possession but prior to the \n\neviction.  Thus, the notice need only be given once in order to secure the landlord\u2019s right \n\nto continue receiving and to accepting rent as well as to continue pursuing possession of \n\nthe leased premises.  (See 2018 amendments to Virginia Code Sections 55-225.47 & 55-\n\n248.34:1) \n\n \n\nIn Virginia, tenants are permitted to invoke a one right of redemption during a 12-\n\nmonth period.  If the tenant pays all amounts owing, including rent, late fees, attorney\u2019s \n\nfees, and court costs, at or before the first return date of the unlawful detainer action, then \n\nthe tenant must be permitted to remain in the leased premises.  The tenant, however, may \n\nonly invoke this right of redemption once within a 12-month period.  If the tenant timely \n\ninvokes the one right of redemption, then the landlord must dismiss the pending unlawful \n\ndetainer action at that time.
